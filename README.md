# 📝Introduction📝

This repository contains the code implementation for the paper **SLB-Mamba: A Lightweight Vision Mamba for Closed and Open Set Student Learning Behavior Detection with Game-Theoretic Attention**. SLB-Mamba is designed to efficiently detect and classify student learning behaviors in both closed and open set environments, leveraging game-theoretic attention mechanisms to improve accuracy and robustness.

The current version has been tested on Linux systems with PyTorch 2.0.0 and CUDA 11.7, and it supports Python 3.11.8. The code is also compatible with CUDA 11.7+ versions.
